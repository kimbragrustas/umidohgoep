After murdering his entire family, a man remarries a widow with a teenage daughter in another town and prepares to do it all over again. was browsing prime video and came across this film. i was interested because 1) terry o'quinn and 2) i love that mid- to late-eighties horror aesthetic. it was actually really great, mostly thanks to o'quinn and jill schoelen. the kills are pretty brutal for what i thought was going to be a relatively tame wide-release 80s film, and i can't decide if the opening or the "who am i here?" scene is more unsettling. give it a watch.

And 1 day he pissed off so bad that I decided to buy used panties online and had them mailed to my gf mother with a note saying he was cheating on her. It blew up and he couldn't prove he didn't do it. He is a drunk and would go to dive bars all hours of the night. They got divorced and the wife pretty much got everything. This was a couple years ago. I should feel bad. But if you knew the guy you would applaud Stepfather definition, the husband of one's mother by a later marriage. I (23M) have been on-and-off with a friend (24F) for several years. We've dated two or three times in the 13 years we've known each other, but circumstances arose each time where we were not able to seek our full potential. Once, she moved away over summer vacation to a tone too far to visit. We reconnected and then I went away for college and it didn't work, again. We've never had any glaring issues and have always been friends. The last time we disconnected, I thought it was for good. "You know, a house like this should really have a family in it." —Terry O'Quinn, The Stepfather. In my opinion, alot more could have been done with Maruo. His struggles are very unique, and can explain alot of his decision and motivations throughout the narrative. as it stands right now, Marou is a bastard. complete bastard. hates Fuu, is absent for most of the quints, and doesn't even show up to his daughter's wedding. However, with very few tweaks to his character Marou could become sympathetic, even a likable character while not compromising his key role in the narrative.

Alternatively, they ARE under suspicion, but are just so good at covering their tracks that the protagonist/law enforcement keep coming up empty. Or, the protagonist witnesses or finds evidence but everyone refuses to believe them. I want to clarify that I am not looking for movies where the killer’s demeanour is meant to fool the audience as well (eg. Usual Suspects). Hey y’all! I’m new, and I figured this would be an ideal place to come and rant about my stepfather and some bs that he’s been pulling and how it ruined Christmas for my Mom. Sorry for any formatting issues, I’m on mobile. Just for a little background, my Stepdad was born with a malformed hand. It’s there but it’s barely functional. This would be absolutely fine, if he wasn’t so set on being a “manly man” and only accepting jobs that “manly men” do. Which, again would be fine, if he didn’t.
